# Basic stems configuration example
#
# This file shows a complete configuration for recording with stems.
# Copy this to your project directory as `stems.yaml` and customize.

devices:
  # Audio device for input and output (uses single clock domain)
  # Can be a device name substring or index number
  # Examples: "ES-9", "BlackHole 16ch", "BlackHole 16ch + ES-9", "0"
  # Omit to use system default device
  audio: "BlackHole 16ch + ES-9"

  # Monitor output channels (1-indexed, stereo pair)
  # For aggregate devices, calculate: base_channels + physical_device_start
  # Example: BlackHole (1-16) + ES-9 (17-32), so use 17-18 for ES-9 L+R
  # Defaults to "1-2" if omitted
  monitorch: "17-18"

  # MIDI input device for transport control (Start/Stop/Clock)
  # Can be a device name substring or index number
  # Omit to use first available MIDI device (if any)
  midiin: "mc-source-b"

# Input track configuration (optional)
# Only configure tracks you want to customize
# Track numbers are 1-based and match the UI display
tracks:
  1:
    arm: false        # Armed for recording (default: false)
    monitor: true     # Heard in monitor output (default: false)
    solo: false       # Solo mode (default: false)
    level: 1.0        # Volume 0.0-1.0 (default: 1.0)
    pan: -0.5         # Pan -1.0 (left) to 1.0 (right) (default: 0.0)

  2:
    monitor: true
    level: 0.9
    pan: 0.5

  3:
    monitor: true
    level: 0.3
    pan: -1.0

  4:
    monitor: true
    level: 0.3
    pan: 1.0

  # Tracks 5-9: Not configured, use defaults

  10:
    monitor: true
  11:
    monitor: true
  12:
    monitor: true
    level: 0.7

# Audio file playback (optional)
# Files are pre-loaded into memory at startup
# Must be 48kHz WAV files (mono or stereo)
# Files loop continuously during playback
# Uncomment the section below to enable audio playback:
#
# audio:
#   # Backing track or previous recording to play along with
#   - file: backing-track.wav     # Path relative to working directory
#     monitor: true               # Hear this file (default: true)
#     solo: false                 # Solo this file (default: false)
#     level: 0.8                  # Volume 0.0-1.0 (default: 1.0)
#     pan: 0.0                    # Pan -1.0 to 1.0 (default: 0.0)

# Notes:
# - Playback starts/stops with MIDI transport (synchronized with recording)
# - Mix recording (armed in UI) includes both input tracks and playback audio
